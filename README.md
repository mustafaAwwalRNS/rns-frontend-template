# Welcone to RNS Front-End template
This template is made using NextJS.

## Getting Started
Intall the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Now you can run the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features of this template
- Highly scalable follwoing the atomic design pattern.
- Better for SEO and performance as compared to react.
- Use of react functional components.
- Separation of concerns between the view and the logic.
- Tested mostly by user perspective.
- Mock servers for testing and development.
- Theming and styling using styled-components. A css-in-js solution.
- High code reusibility.
- Best practices.
